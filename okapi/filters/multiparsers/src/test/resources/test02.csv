5a99d3c91f22f01200067dba,Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve,"If you are seeking tranquility, Great Sand Dunes may the place for you. It is the quietest national park in the Lower 48 states. ",ENG,,"When you visit Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado, you may be surprised to also find a diverse landscape of grasslands, wetlands, conifer and aspen forests, alpine lakes, and tundra!

Of course, the sand dunes are the main attraction, and you won’t be disappointed. You will be awestruck by the beauty of the tallest dunes in North America, which rise to a maximum height of 750 feet and cover an area of 19,000 acres. These dunes started forming less than 440,000 years ago.

Popular activities on the dunes include sandboarding and sand sledding – just be sure to use equipment that is specially designed with slick bases to slide down the sand.

At Medrano Creek in the park, it can almost feel like you're at the ocean – visitors here build sandcastles and float through waves that are formed by small underwater sand dunes.

Great Sand Dunes National Park also features soaring mountains, with six peaks over 13,000 feet in elevation. On hikes like the Montville Nature Trail, you can see abundant wildlife, including herds of bison and elk, and fields of flowers in the high-mountain meadows.

The beauty and varied landscapes of this park are not to be missed!"

##1. Plan Those Meals
It’s six o’clock and somewhere a woman is pulling out her hair trying to decide what to cook for dinner. Unless she has a weekly meal plan, which can prevent all that anxiety-induced hair loss—and be a super-savings secret weapon. “You don’t have to spend a lot to eat well,” says Jonni McCoy, author of Miserly Moms: Living Well on Less in a Tough Economy (miserlymoms.com), who makes her weekly meal plan based on what’s on sale at her favorite grocers.  
**You Save:** If planning meals prevents just one last-minute call for delivery pizza, you’ll save at least $20.

##2. Eat the Sales
To maximize the benefits of shopping sales, make your meal plan flexible. Before you head to the store, check the sales online and in the newspaper. You can check for sales at RedPlum.com as well as in your local newspaper (coupons and savings are usually found on the front and back pages).  
**You Save:** You can significantly reduce your grocery bill by shopping sales—McCoy says she whittles hundreds of dollars from her grocery bill by checking sales before she heads to the store.

#### Important for Fall Prevention  


Each year, more than one-third of people age 65 or older fall. Falls and fall-related injuries, such as hip fracture, can have a serious impact on an older person's life. If you fall, it could limit your activities or make it impossible to live independently. Balance exercises, along with certain strength exercises, can help prevent falls by improving your ability to control and maintain your body's position, whether you are moving or still.
