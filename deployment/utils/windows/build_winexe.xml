	This file build Windows executables. It should be run only when something changes in the .exe configuration or
	for some reasons the .exe needs to be updated.
	The built .exe is placed in the win32 directory. It should be copy to the proper location.
	This means the main build can be done a) without installing launch4j and b) on non-Windows platforms.
