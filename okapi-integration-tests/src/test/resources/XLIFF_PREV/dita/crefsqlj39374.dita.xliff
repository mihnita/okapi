<source xml:lang="en">This section provides manual pages for both high-level language constructs and parts thereof. For example, the CREATE INDEX statement is a high-level statement that you can execute directly via the JDBC interface. This section also includes clauses, which are not high-level statements and which you cannot execute directly but only as part of a high-level statement. The ORDER BY and WHERE clauses are examples of this kind of clause. Finally, this section also includes some syntactically complex portions of statements called expressions, for example <bpt id="1" ctype="x-i">&lt;i&gt;</bpt><bpt id="2" ctype="x-xref">&lt;xref href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression"&gt;</bpt>selectExpression<ept id="2">&lt;/xref&gt;</ept><ept id="1">&lt;/i&gt;</ept> and <bpt id="3" ctype="x-i">&lt;i&gt;</bpt><bpt id="4" ctype="x-xref">&lt;xref
href="rreftablesubquery.dita#rreftablesubquery"&gt;</bpt>tableSubquery<ept id="4">&lt;/xref&gt;</ept>.<ept id="3">&lt;/i&gt;</ept> These clauses and expressions receive their own manual pages for ease of reference.</source>
