<source xml:lang="en">During the development of a database application, most IDEs allow you to test individual database connections and queries without running the entire application. When you test an individual database connection or query (which requires a database connection), the IDE might launch a JVM that runs in a specialized testing environment. In this case, when a test completes, the JVM remains active and available for further testing, and the database connection established during the test remains open.</source>
