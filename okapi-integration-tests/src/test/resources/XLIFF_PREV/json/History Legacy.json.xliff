&lt;p&gt;The W.K. Kellogg Foundation&amp;rsquo;s mission, work and values are rooted in the experience and perspective of our founder, Will Keith Kellogg. To understand the former, it is helpful to know something of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A7BECB9089CC407B820756EB126C1EC9&amp;amp;_z=z"&gt;The First Half-Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class="deltaHdr"&gt;Early Life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W.K. Kellogg was born April 7, 1860, to Michigan pioneer parents, Seventh Day Adventists who valued modesty, healthy living and hard work. Those attributes also describe much of Mr. Kellogg's life and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kellogg went to work in the family broom business at age 14, quitting school after teachers mistook his then-undiagnosed vision problems (which ultimately left him nearly blind) for lack of intellect. At age 20, he joined his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, at the Battle Creek Sanitarium (the &amp;ldquo;San&amp;rdquo;), then a leading health spa. Often working as many as 120 hours a week, he filled positions from errand boy to business manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one such role, working one night in the San's kitchen to find a digestible substitute for bread, Mr. Kellogg accidentally let stand a batch of boiled wheat. By morning, the wheat had turned to flakes, which became the basis for Corn Flakes and, in 1906, the Kellogg Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Kellogg became one of the world's wealthiest men, he was never quite comfortable in that role (on being told he'd become a millionaire, he responded, "I am no such thing!") and felt obligated to use his fortune to benefit others. As early as 1909, he wrote, "If I am successful in getting out of debt, and become prosperous, I expect to make good use of any wealth that may come to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the foundation he established in 1930 &amp;ndash; originally named the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation &amp;ndash; he proved true to his word, instructing the staff to, &amp;ldquo;Use the money as you please so long as it promotes the health, happiness and well-being of children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
