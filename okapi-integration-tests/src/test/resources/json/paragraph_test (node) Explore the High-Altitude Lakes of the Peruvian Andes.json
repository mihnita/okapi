I chew on the thought as I trudge up the last set of switchbacks into even thinner air, pausing often to fill my lungs.

It extends some 124 miles through&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sernanp.gob.pe\/huascaran\">Huascar\u00e1n National Park<\/a>, housing 722 glaciers and 882 lakes. It has so many lakes, in fact, that officials seemed to run out of names, numbering most of them instead. It makes trip planning difficult, almost arbitrary. So in deciding where to go, we asked the owner of our B&amp;B in Huaraz, a small, dusty city in northern Peru. He recommended&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.peruhop.com\/laguna-69-peru\/\">Laguna 69<\/a>&nbsp;as the nicest in the entire range. With little more than its number, we were off to behold it for ourselves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a two-and-a-half-hour shuttle, we&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/cordillerablanca.info\/\">set out from the national park trailhead<\/a>&nbsp;at Cebollapampa to complete the 9-mile out-and-back in time to get dinner back in town. Having already spent a few nights in Huaraz at 10,000 feet, we made relatively easy work of the first 4 miles of the route, ducking beneath the long arms of native quenual trees and following the Llanganuco river through a verdant valley. Green moss smothered every surface, while the whitewater gushed past boulders, guiding us up into the alpine zone. There, we paused to eat lunch in a meadow below the snowy ramparts of 17,913-foot Yanapaccha, where the view stretches back to Huascar\u00e1n, the highest peak in Peru at 22,205 feet.<\/p>\r\n"}],"_lingotek_metadata":{"_entity_type_id":"paragraph","_entity_id":"25","_entity_revision":"30"}},{"field_section_heading":[{"value":"The Meadow"}],"field_section_content":[{"value":"<p>From the meadow, the rocky path snakes upvalley, gaining more than 500 feet in the last half-mile to the lip of a glacial moraine that hides Laguna 69.
