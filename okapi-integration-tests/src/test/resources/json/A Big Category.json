Julia previously competed on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/insidesurvivor.com\/the-50-best-survivor-episodes-no-30-8245\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Survivor: Caramoan &ndash; Fans vs. Favorites<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;as a member of the fans tribe where she finished in 13th place. She is the highest-finishing female in NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series championship history and&nbsp;in&nbsp;2016 was chosen for the NASCAR Next class which honors the most promising racers around the world. Julia shares the list alongside athletes such as four-time Olympic gold medal winning gymnast Simone Biles and Denver Broncos Outside Linebacker Von Miller.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Forbes has been presenting the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/carolinehoward\/2017\/01\/03\/meet-the-2017-class-of-30-under-30\/#3bee1bdbd243\" target=\"_blank\">30 Under 30<\/a>&nbsp;for the past six years; they describe the list as &ldquo;an annual opportunity to embrace the optimism, inventiveness and boldness of youth.&rdquo; The 2017 Class includes 600 men and women under 30-years-old from across 20 different industries. Previous honorees include Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence, and Grammy nominated artist Chance the Rapper.<\/p>\n\n<p>The competition level is extremely high when it comes to making it onto the list. Forbes stated that there were over 15,000 nominations for just 600 spots. Basically, a 4% acceptance rate, which Forbes said makes it &ldquo;harder to get into than the nation&rsquo;s two most selective colleges, Stanford University (4.8%) and Harvard University (5.2%).&rdquo; However, Julia is a former Stanford graduate, so is clearly used to overcoming the odds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inside Survivor would like to offer our hearty congratulations to Julia Landauer! Unfortunately, none of the under-30s from the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/insidesurvivor.com\/cast\/season-34-cast\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Survivor: Game Changers<\/em>&nbsp;cast<\/a>&nbsp;made the cut.<\/p>\n\n\n"},"mindtouch.page#overview":"this is a big category, of course!"}
