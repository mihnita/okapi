Compared to the try-fail method, in which practitioners usually generate thousands of ideas before finding a really useful concept for developing a new product or service, Six Sigma\u2019s systematic approach may be seen as a threat to creativity.\r\n\r\nClearly, there is a conflict here: Is it worth generating really innovative ideas, assuming the costs and time of the many attempts required?\r\n\r\nUsually, when companies face such a problem, they tend to adopt conciliating solutions to get partial benefits of both options. But this often also means assuming the costs of both. To gain greater benefits at a lower cost, a better plan for integration is needed.\r\n<h3>The\u00a0Solution in TRIZ<\/h3>\r\nOne technique for eliminating the conflict between innovation and Six Sigma is TRIZ, which is the (Russian) acronym for the \u201cTheory of Inventive Problem Solving.\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.isixsigma.com\/dictionary\/triz\/\">TRIZ<\/a>\u00a0is an innovation algorithm toolkit for generating solutions more effectively, and was developed in the former U.S.S.R. by G.S. Altshuller and his colleagues between 1946 and 1985.\r\n\r\nTRIZ comes from the principle that any innovative idea or development always aims to improve ideality, which is the relation between useful or desired effects generated by the developed system and undesired effects of the same system, either resources used or harmful effects.\r\n\r\nWidening useful effects often also implies widening the harmful effects, which brings up a conflict. During TRIZ development, by studying millions of patent requests registered in the U.S.S.R., researchers noticed that in many cases the same obstacle to increasing the ideality of a solution was solved in a similar way by a number of inventors in different scenarios, mostly using the try-fail method. After observing that solutions developed in a specific situation can be applied to other problems, even outside the industries or areas of knowledge in which they have been conceived, Altshuller proposed developing systematic methods to make this evolving process of innovative solutions easier. By making use of algorithms proposed by TRIZ, it is possible to study a system and quickly identify innovative solutions to eliminate conflicts, thus avoiding conciliating solutions.","post_excerpt":""}}
