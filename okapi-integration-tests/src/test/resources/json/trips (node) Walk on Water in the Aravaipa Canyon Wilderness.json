Sorry, old friend, but places this special deserve to be shared.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Turn-by-turn from the West Trailhead<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dip into&nbsp;<strong>Aravaipa Canyon<\/strong>&nbsp;and pick your way roughly 5 miles up the streambed to&nbsp;<strong>Horse Camp<\/strong>&nbsp;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continue approximately 3.5 miles along the canyon floor, following faint user trails and wading through ankle- and knee-deep water, to&nbsp;<strong>Deer Creek Canyon.&nbsp;<\/strong>(Despite being marked \u201cHell\u2019s Hole Canyon\u201d on some topos, Deer Creek Canyon is anything but: It\u2019s quiet, narrow, and nontechnical.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore the straightforward canyon as long and far as you like. (The author turned around at the spring about 2 miles in, but it goes farther.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retrace your steps back to the West trailhead.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Campsite: Horse Camp (mile 5)<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nestled in a grove of sycamores, a handful of sandy platforms rise above the water where Aravaipa and Horse Camp Canyons intersect. Make a basecamp at the one where several mesquite trees offer privacy from the \u201ctrail.\u201d From your backcountry digs, explore Horse Camp Canyon, where some easy scrambling lands you at the foot of a 50-foot-tall pour-off.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Wildlife<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.backpacker.com\/survival\/the-truth-about-bears-the-skills\">Black bears<\/a>, bighorn sheep, and both of Arizona\u2019s deer species call Aravaipa home, but perhaps the coolest (read: cutest) resident is the white-nosed coati. Though rare in the U.S., this relative of the raccoon hangs out in large groups throughout the canyon. They look like miniature black bear cubs with long, monkey-like tails. (Store your food in critter-proof sacks; coatis are harmless, but mischievous.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Options<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This route offers the easiest logistics, but if you have a second vehicle (and don\u2019t mind up to four hours of additional drive time), leave a shuttle at the East trailhead (32.898658, -110.418427). On day two, trek 7.4 miles through Aravaipa from Horse Camp to your car to make it a 12.4-miler with no backtracking.<\/p>\r\n","summary":"\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this place.\u201d This is my hiking partner\u2019s entreaty after two days in\u00a0Aravaipa Canyon.
