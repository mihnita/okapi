It has been designed according to <tref id="5969" /> and is engineered with the programming and debugging system <tref id="6558" />.</p><p translate="yes" class="none" image="none" id="5966">The XXX function is a licensed software package that generally enables the YYYY to run XXX applications and to communicate with <tref id="6558" /> for loading and debugging applications. It is started at boot time of the YYYY if a XXX function is added to the configuration.</p><p id="5966">Once started on a YYYY, the XXX function is running in shared mode with lower priority compared to the ZZZZZ software.</p><p id="1260">It is possible to design a configuration with XXX function and ZZZZZ activities running on different YYYYs. Since both communicate via internal communication, the XXX function can run on any YYYY within the <tref id="5952" /> series. This provides maximum processor power for each of the activities.</p><p id="1260">The XXX development system is described in Part 6 of the Function Description.</p></Text></Topic>
