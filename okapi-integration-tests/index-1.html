<h1 id="okapi-integration-tests">Okapi Integration Tests</h1>
<p>All long running tests for Okapi should go here. Normally round trip tests or any tests that process full files.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p>The <code>logback-test.xml</code> configuration file in <code>src\test\resources\</code> reduces the log level of <code>net.sf.okapi.common.pipelinedriver</code> to <code>WARN</code>.<br>
Without it the continuous integration build fails. The log limit is 4MB, and we can't change it (controlled by GitLab)<br>
Please don't change the level, and don't remove the file. If you do it in your local copy please don't commit it.</p>
<p><strong>Example Test File Directory Structure:</strong></p>
<p>```</p>
<h1 id="_1">!</h1>
<p>xmlstream
   normal.xml
   pcdata_tests
      okf_xmlstream@pcdata.fprm
      okf_html@pcdata.secondary.fprm
      pcdata.xml
```</p>
<p>Each subdirectory is assumed to contain a custom filter config and possible secondary config. Following the Naming convention is important for the test code to auto-detect the config files. Files in the root directory (and sub-directories) are processed with the default parameters of the filter. Then each sub-directory is processed using the custom config files. Also be mindful that the tests include all the file extensions for your test files.</p>
<p>Bilingual file's locales are auto-detected.</p>
<p>These conventions allow large numbers of files and configurations to be tested with standard code. Any files that are added to "integration-tests-common" will be automatically tested by other integration tests that assume the above conventions (for example integration-tests-tkit)</p>
<p>Test files that fail should be given a "_FAIL" suffix. This will mark them so they are not included in the tests and warn developers that these files have issues. Some integration tests are marked with "@Ignore(...)". This may not mean there is a problem, only that comparison of the different files found differences. In some cases the latest code may be correct. Please look at these tests carefully and if possible suggest a better way to compare the results.</p>
<p>Info on how to update the golden files (from Jim):</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the integration tests in Eclipse (Right Clisk -&gt; Maven -&gt; Update Project). Be sure to select the option to force update of snaphots.</li>
<li>Run the tkit integration tests (net.sf.okapi.tkit.integration) to generate the updated XLIFF.</li>
<li>Navigate to "../okapi-integration-tests/target/test-classes/.." and select the new xliff files. Be sure to also copy over the ones in sub-directories.</li>
<li>Copy the xliff files to the corresponding directories under "../okapi-integration-tests/src/test/resources/XLIFF_M28_05_12_2015"</li>
<li>Do a refresh in eclipse and re-run the XLIFF compare you should see everything pass.</li>
</ol>
